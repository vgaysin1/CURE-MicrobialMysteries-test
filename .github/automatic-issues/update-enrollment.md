OTTR and C-MOOR_Template are always works in progress.
We are working on adding more features and smoothing out bugs as we go.

To receive updates, you will need to enroll this repository by adding it to the `sync.yml` file.

- [ ] Add your repo to C-MOOR_Template [`sync.yml`](https://github.com/C-MOOR/C-MOOR_Template/blob/main/.github/sync.yml)
  - Here are the [instructions for receiving OTTR updates](https://www.ottrproject.org/getting_started.html#8_Enroll_your_repository_for_OTTR_updates_(Not_required_but_highly_encouraged)). 
 For C-MOOR_Template, follow the instructions, but instead of adding your repo to the OTTR_Template `sync.yml` as described, add it to the C-MOOR_Template [`sync.yml`](https://github.com/C-MOOR/C-MOOR_Template/blob/main/.github/sync.yml) file.  C-MOOR_Template will pass along updates from OTTR after making any necessary adjustments.
