## Forking

This module uses OTTR to render R Markdown content into multiple formats.  If you would like to fork this repository, you can learn more about how OTTR works by visiting [ottrproject.org](https://www.ottrproject.org/)
  
OTTR helps you:

- Edit and write a course in [RMarkdown files](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and have it published to multiple different platforms:
  - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/bookstore?type=course)
  - [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)
  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- Have [Github action robots](https://www.ottrproject.org/customize-robots.html) do your repetitive tasks like spell check and re-rendering.
- Use [automagic conversion](https://github.com/jhudsl/ottrpal) to ease the lift of prepping the material for different platforms' formats.
- Use [our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jhudsl/base_ottr) for consistency across authors as well as to help you [avoid dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).
