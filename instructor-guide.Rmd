C-MOOR Microbial Mysteries CURE content overview.

## Course Description

Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University in the Spring of 2025 as AS.020.126.01.SP25 Microbial Mysteries: Genomics from Ground to Gut.

<br>

Microorganisms surround us, from the microbes in our soil to the bacteria in our digestive systems.  As part of the C-MOOR project [https://www.c-moor.org](https://www.c-moor.org), this Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) introduces computational tools using Galaxy [https://usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) and SciServer [https://sciserver.org](https://sciserver.org) to analyze metagenomic datasets that you will use to conduct independent projects.  Dig into soil metagenomics datasets generated by the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium [http://biodigs.gdscn.org](http://biodigs.gdscn.org) and study the soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns or explore publicly accessible human gut metagenomics datasets [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) and study how our microbiomes are shaped by our diet, medications, and genetics.  
This course progresses through a series of Core Labs that introduce important concepts and tools necessary to complete a Capstone Project.  Students work in groups and present frequently during class periods similar to research lab meetings in order to receive and provide community analysis and feedback.  This course is open to all students, regardless of major.  No prior computational experience necessary.
