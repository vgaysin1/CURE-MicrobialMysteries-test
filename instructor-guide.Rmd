C-MOOR Microbial Mysteries CURE content overview.


## Course Content

The Microbial Mysteries course content was organized and presented by way of Unit modules below. Each unit has a main theme, reflected by the unit title. Practically, each unit is a week covering both, themed assignments and those from previous and next units, including any other additional material an instructor wishes to cover. 


- Each class duration was 1 hour and 15 minutes

- Core units 1, 2, 3 and 4, over the coure of 4 weeks and 8 classes (1 unit per week and 2 classes/week) was typically associated with 1.5-2.5 hrs of homework per class, or 3-5 hours of homework per week. The amount of homework is based on: 

a) For each hour of class students were generally expected to spend approximately 2 hours of independent study time (homework). 

b) To ensure meaningful coverage of important concepts and scientific content and computational skills necessary to proceed to next step and subsequently execute independent group project work. 

- Typically, each class began with either a discussion or a presentation based on homework from a previous session.


Course content was organized broadly into 3 categories:

1. Structured (Core) Units - on weekly basis, Units 0 through 4
2. Research Module (Project Work) - over the course of 7-8 weeks
3. Professional Development Module - over the course of 4 weeks

### Structured Units

### Research Module 

Research Module is mainly dedicated to group project work, with intervening Professional Development Sessions such as Scientific Talks. During their project work that spans ~8 weeks, students do research work towards their project, prepare and update relevant documents (e.g. Written Doc, poster slide deck) and separately meet with instructor to get help with project direction and execution and ask questions.

- Project Work consisted of In-Class Round Table activities, and Written Updates + Advisory Meetings.

#### **Project Work In-Class Round Table**

Over the course of the Project work, students present:

- 4-5 times Round Table Data (once per week): 
- 4-5 times Round Table Troubleshooting (once per week)
- Project work was intermixed with professional development (PD) activities including Science Talks, Scientific Communication activity, and Next Steps activity.
