## Activity: Taxonomy Profiling Spreadsheet

## Activity: A short introduction to Galaxy

## Homework: Pre-lab: Scientific Literature 

### Purpose 

Obtain a high level overview of metagenomics by reading
R.D. Sleator, C. Shortall, and C. Hill.  Metagenomics.  Letters in Applied Microbiology. 2008 Nov;47(5):361-6. [(pubmed.gov/19146522)](http://pubmed.gov/19146522)

### Learning Objectives 

- Read a review paper that summarizes the field of metagenomics.
- Broadly understand the scope of the review and the gaps in the field. 

### Introduction 

The vast majority of all micro-organisms on Earch remain uncultured [(K.G. Lloyd et al, 2019)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00055-18). Additionally, in complex environments like soil and water, most micro-organisms remain unidentified [(M. Delgado-Baquerizo, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-019-0405-0). The field of metagenomics is a culture-independend approach which aims to remedy these gaps in knowledge [(J. Handelsman, 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590779/). Metagenomics is the study of genomic (sequencing) data obtained directly from environmental (and other, e.g. clinical) samples and provides new meaningful information on the diversity and function of microorganisms.


### Activity

*Estimated time: 50 min*

#### Instructions

Read the review paper “Metagenomics” by Sleator, Shortall, and Hill, 2008 Lett Appl Microbiol and answer the following questions.

#### Questions

1. What is one thing you learned or find interesting in the paper?

2. Define a term that is new to you (e.g. metagenome, microbiome, 16S rRNA).

3. Ask a question about the review paper.

## Discussion: Scientific Literature Prelab

## Lecture: Scientific Literature

## Homework: Scientific Literature Activity

### Purpose

Examine research on metagenomic diversity by reading Xue, *et al*. Metagenome sequencing and 103 microbial genomes from ballast water and sediments. Scientific Data.2023 Aug 10;10(1):536. [(pubmed.gov/37563185)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563185/)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and experimental setup of the paper
- Understand the presented evidence (Figures and Tables) of the paper

### Introduction

Understanding microbial composition and diversity in different environments is critical for assessing the benefits and threats of the bacterial community in that environment.  In the publication by [Xue, et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563185/), the authors study microbial diversity in the ballast-tank water from two ships, with the idea that such a unique and isolated water environment may select for specific microbes.  Luckily in their research they don’t find bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, but that is exactly what they would find in the ballast water of cargo ships if they did the analysis during the cholera pandemic(s) of the 1800s.

### Activity

*Estimated time: 90 min*

#### Instructions

Based on the study by Xue, et al.2023, answer the following questions.  The main text of the paper and the supplement can be found below, in the  'Resources' section of this assignment.

#### Overview of the Paper (in class)

Determine the main objectives and purpose of the paper. Read the Abstract and the introduction with your group.

1. What is the purpose of this study?

2. What is the hypothesis in this study?

3. Describe the knowledge gap. In essence, what did the scientific community not know that this study was trying to answer?


#### Methods (in class and homework)

1. Discuss how many and what samples were used for this study? Are there any replicates?

2. Discuss some methods used in this paper.

3. Discuss steps authors used to ensure their data is available to the public.

#### Figures (in class and Homework)

**Methods.** How did the researchers test their hypothesis? Explain in your own words the methods in each figure.
