C-MOOR Microbial Mysteries CURE content overview.


## Course Content

The Microbial Mysteries course content was organized and presented by way of Unit modules below. Each unit has a main theme, reflected by the unit title. Practically, each unit is a week covering both, themed assignments and those from previous and next units, including any other additional material an instructor wishes to cover.

<br>

Course content was organized broadly into 2 categories:

1. Structured Units - on weekly basis
2. Research Module - over the course of 7 weeks
3. Professional Development Module - over the course of 4 weeks
