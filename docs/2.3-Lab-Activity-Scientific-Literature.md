# 2.3 Lab Activity: Scientific Literature

## 2.3.1 Purpose, Learning Objectives and Introduction

### 2.3.1-1 Purpose

Examine research on metagenomic diversity by reading Xue, *et al*. Metagenome sequencing and 103 microbial genomes from ballast water and sediments. Scientific Data.2023 Aug 10;10(1):536. [(pubmed.gov/37563185)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563185/)

### 2.3.1-2 Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and experimental setup of the paper
- Understand the presented evidence (Figures and Tables) of the paper

### 2.3.1-3 Introduction

Understanding microbial composition and diversity in different environments is critical for assessing the benefits and threats of the bacterial community in that environment.  In the publication by [Xue, et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563185/), the authors study microbial diversity in the ballast-tank water from two ships, with the idea that such a unique and isolated water environment may select for specific microbes.  Luckily in their research they donâ€™t find bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, but that is exactly what they would find in the ballast water of cargo ships if they did the analysis during the cholera pandemic(s) of the 1800s.
