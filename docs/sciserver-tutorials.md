## Meet R!

### Introduction

R is a popular programming language for statistical computing and data visualization [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language).  Notable features include the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio) built to help you be more productive with R (and Python); the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/packages) collection of packages that aims to make data science faster, easier, and more fun; and importantly the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org) project with its active support community and robust genomics tooling.  Now that you completed “test-driveR” and got a taste of analyzing a real world genomics dataset using R it’s time to learn more about how R stores and operates on data using concepts such as variables, vectors, and data.frames.

### Activity

*Estimated time: 25 min*

#### Instructions

1. Resume your C-MOOR LearnR container

  a. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account.

  b. Click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page.

  c. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”.

  d. Resume your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name.

2. Complete your next LearnR tutorial

  a. Click on “Meet R!”. The tutorial will open in a new tab.

  b. Complete the tutorial and answer the questions below.

#### Questions

|1. Variables – Define what is a variable, give a line of R code that stores information in a variable, and explain how one would view the data stored in a variable.|
|:--|
| Define variable:|
| Code:|
| Explain:|
<br>

|2. Vectors – Provide two lines of R code, one which stores a vector of numbers in a variable, and one which performs a mathematical operation on each element of that variable (e.g. multiplication). |
|:--|
|Code 1:|
|Code 2:|
<br>

|3. Plotting – Copy and paste as text your code from the final code block in the tutorial.  Also insert a screenshot of your resulting plot.|

## R for Data Science 1 

### Introduction

[R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) covers how to do data science with R using the tidyverse collection of packages.  There are many possible reasons for the continued popularity of tidyverse, but one stand out principle the package authors embrace is that programs should be “easy to use by humans.  Computer efficiency is a secondary concern” (see this and more at the [tidy tools manifesto](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html#design-for-humans0).  Here you will learn more about what kind of data can be organized into data.frames and possible ways to summarize, explore, and visualize datasets.

### Activity

*Estimated time: 50 min*

#### Instructions

1. Complete the “r4ds” LearnR tutorial.

- In addition to the “OCS – Global Diets” section being optional, you similarly do not need to complete all of the Exercises in 3.3.1.

2. Answer the questions below.

#### Questions

|1. data.frames – Data frames organize data into a 2-dimensional table of rows and columns like a spreadsheet with some special restrictions.  For the mpg data.frame, what do rows represent?  What do columns represent?|

|2. Functions – Most R commands are functions (e.g. `mean()`) which take some input (a number, a vector, a dataframe...) and produce some output (a summary, a plot, a new vector...).  Describe one function you learned about that you anticipate being useful in the future.|

|3. Common Problems – What are some common problems you ran into?  Refer to Part 2. Troubleshooting if you'd like some inspiration for how to put your experience into words.|

|4. [*optional*] OCS - Global Diets Plotting – Which foods show a difference based on sex?|
