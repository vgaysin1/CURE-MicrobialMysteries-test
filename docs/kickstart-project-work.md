### Activity 4 – Use a new Galaxy tool that may be useful for your project

#### Instructions

Find one new Galaxy tool that you think may be useful for your research project.  A few possibilities to get you started include:

- Prokka [Galaxy tutorial](http://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/annotation-with-prokka/tutorial.html)
- Bakta [Galaxy Tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/bacterial-genome-annotation/tutorial.html)
- antiSMASH [Galaxy tutorial](http://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/secondary-metabolite-discovery/tutorial.html 
- CheckM2 [Galaxy tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/bacterial-genome-quality-control/tutorial.html)
- Tools mentioned in tutorials like [GTN: Bacterial Genome Annotation](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/bacterial-genome-annotation/tutorial.html)
- Tools used in workflows like [https://nf-co.re/mag](https://nf-co.re/mag) (not all tools will be available on Galaxy)

#### Questions

|1. Briefly describe the tool e.g. how it works, what it takes as input, and what it produces as output.|
|:--------|
||
<br>

|2. Describe briefly any problems you had running the tool and troubleshooting steps you tried.|

## Project Work Organizer

### Purpose

**Kickstart Project Work** - The purpose of kickstart project work is to gain practice in scientific exploration and research, communication, and work on your scientific poster! A few ideas to get you started can be found in the **Possible Datasets** Lecture and Acvitivity below. **Your project work will culminate in Poster making, sharing and presentation.** a. Each group will present their capstone project during an in-class poster presentation. 

<br>

**Project Work phase** contains many elements to scaffold your research as you progress towards a final poster presentation.  These include round table updates, written check-ins, advisory meetings, and peer reviews.  During the Project Work phase, you will be documenting, summarizing and updating relevant documenents which will fall under 3 categories:

<br>

```
- **1. Round Table Data & Troubleshooting** - Reviewed and discussed as a community In-Class 
- **2. Written Check-Ins** - Group-specific write-ups checked by instructor(s)**
- **3. Advisory Meetings** - Group-specific in-person meetings between individual groups and instructor(s)**
```


<br>

**Project Work Organizer** - Research lab meetings are great forums to receive community analysis and feedback.  Many classes going forward will be spent discussing your project progress, alternating between data results and troubleshooting methods.  Refer to this organizer to see what we’ll discuss on a given day and find the appropriate slidedeck.

<br>

<mark style="background color: yellow">Use this organizer to find instructions and track documents.

### Round Table Data & Troubleshooting

Research lab meetings are great forums to receive community analysis and feedback. In-class round table data and troubleshooting sessions and slidedecks will be used to report on and get feedback on your ongoing research. Consider these in-class project work updates your research lab meetings!

#### Instructions

**1. Track and share your work and progress using Slidedecks**

a. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Round Table Data** for all groups 

b. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Round Table Troubleshooting**  for all groups

c. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Poster** for all groups

d. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Final Presentation** for all groups

**2. Use the following (sample) project Work organizer for your In-class Project Work updates.**

```
|Course Week | Day 1 | Day 2
|:--| --|-- | 
|7| Round Table Data| |
|8| Round Table Troubleshooting| | 
|9| Slidedeck - Round Table Data| Round Table Troubleshooting |
|10| Slidedeck - Round Table Data| Round Table Troubleshooting |
|11| Slidedeck Poster Review| Poster Review |
|12| Science Talks| |
|13| Final Presentations | |
```

### Written check-ins

Written check-ins encompass a written document for groups-instructor interaction, and will also be used for peer reviews. 

#### Instructions

**1. Track and share your work and progress using test document**

For each group, instructor will create a text document **Doc** which will include the following sections:

**a. Written Check-in (Doc)** - Progress will be assessed through several written check-ins.  These documents will allow you to summarize the work you’ve done, receive feedback from colleagues, and provide another opportunity to ask for help.  Your check-in should be concise but complete (full sentences) and include the following information:

- New progress since last submission (15 pts)
- How you’ve addressed prior feedback (15 pts)
- Poster organization (10 pts)
- Struggles you are encountering and questions you would like advice on (10 pts)

**b. Written Check-in (Poster)** - The second written check-in will focus on starting your poster using material you developed for your Round Table updates.  Posters should be 30 inches wide and we have provided a template with example two and three column formats.  You can make your own design by selecting the Blank layout.  Kickstart your poster by adding the following details:

- Title and authors (10 pts)
- Hypothesis along with diagram or figure (10 pts)
- Dataset table with sample metadata including accession ID, collection method, etc. (10 pts)
- Methods in the form of details and figure (10 pts)
- Results (10 pts)

**c. Peer Review** - Each person will work individually to peer review two separate projects.  Review the poster associated with each project and provide feedback in group's Check-in document on the following:

- Aspects of the project that you find fascinating
- Questions you have about the approach or results
- Suggestions on next steps, poster organization, etc.

### Advisory Meetings

**Advisory Meeting** - Each group will schedule a meeting with the instructors to discuss their progress.  These meetings will take place outside of class and should be scheduled before the deadline.  A link to the when2meet schedule can be found in the Group Information section.

### Sample project work organizer 

With your instructor, during your Project Work, fill out the Project Work organizer below. 

```
|Group | Check-in | Poster | Meeting #1 | Meeting # 2|
|:--| :--| :-- | :-- | :-- | 
|Group A| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
|Group B| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
|Group C| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
|Group D| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
<br>
```
