# Online Community

The genomic data science community is a remarkably open community that continually strives to increase opportunitites and broaden access to the scientific enterprise (e.g. [GDSCN 2022](https://pubmed.gov/35858750){target="_blank"}).
There are many opportunities to interact online with scientists that share a common research question, career stage, or even favorite tool!
