# About {-}

## Course Description

Microorganisms surround us, from the microbes in our soil to the bacteria in our digestive systems.  As part of the C-MOOR project [https://www.c-moor.org](https://www.c-moor.org), this Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) introduces computational tools using Galaxy [https://usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) and SciServer [https://sciserver.org](https://sciserver.org) to analyze metagenomic datasets that you will use to conduct independent projects.  Dig into soil metagenomics datasets generated by the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium [http://biodigs.gdscn.org](http://biodigs.gdscn.org) and study the soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns or explore publicly accessible human gut metagenomics datasets [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) and study how our microbiomes are shaped by our diet, medications, and genetics.  

<br> 

This course progresses through a series of Core Labs that introduce important concepts and tools necessary to complete a Capstone Project.  Students work in groups and present frequently during class periods similar to research lab meetings in order to receive and provide community analysis and feedback.  This course is open to all students, regardless of major.  No prior computational experience necessary.

<br>

Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University in the Spring of 2025 as AS.020.126.01.SP25 Microbial Mysteries: Genomics from Ground to Gut.

### Audience and Prerequisites {- .unlisted}

What is the target audience?

<!-- Example:
This module is designed for introductory biology courses.  Key ideas center around genes and homologs, and the proteins they encode.  We typically include this module as part of a Molecular Biology unit.
-->

**Prerequisites**:

  - Prereq 1
  - Prereq 2
  
Why are these needed?  Provide a brief explanation that will help instructors decide whether it's a good fit for their students.

<!-- Example:

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of genes and homology

The project portion of the module involves looking up genes in different databases (human and model organism). Students should have a basic understanding of what a gene is (and why we care about them), and why it makes sense to study similar genes (i.e. homologs) across different organisms.  This module will help solidify these concepts by having students investigate concrete examples of genes and their homologs.
