# About {-}

## Course Description

Microorganisms surround us, from the microbes in our soil to the bacteria in our digestive systems.  As part of the C-MOOR project [https://www.c-moor.org](https://www.c-moor.org), this Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) introduces computational tools using Galaxy [https://usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) and SciServer [https://sciserver.org](https://sciserver.org) to analyze metagenomic datasets that you will use to conduct independent projects.  Dig into soil metagenomics datasets generated by the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium [http://biodigs.gdscn.org](http://biodigs.gdscn.org) and study the soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns or explore publicly accessible human gut metagenomics datasets [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) and study how our microbiomes are shaped by our diet, medications, and genetics.  

<br> 

This course progresses through a series of in-person and online learning experiences that introduce important concepts and tools in data analysis and genomics, necessary to subsequently complete a Capstone Project. 
Students work in groups and present frequently during class periods similar to research lab meetings in order to receive and provide community analysis and feedback.  
This course is open to all students, regardless of major.  No prior computational experience necessary.

Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University in the Spring of 2025 as AS.020.126.01.SP25 Microbial Mysteries: Genomics from Ground to Gut.

### Audience and Prerequisites {- .unlisted}

This course is offered to any undergraduate student, with freshmen especially encouraged to take. The course is designed to introduce genomics and data science as apart of flexible reserach-based experience or CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience). Students will learn to analyze metagenomic data from DNA sequencing using a variety of computational tools and resources. Students will then engage in their own project work using the concepts and tools they learned and utilizing publically available metagenomics datasets.

**Prerequisites**:

- Prereq 1: No biology presequisites are required, but basic concepts in biology and genetics are encouraged.
- Prereq 2: No programming, coding or data science experience are required - beginner level.
- Prereq 3: No research experience is required.
  

### Format 

This course is a combination of:
- Lectures
- Pre-labs and other homework assignments
- Activities (homework or in-class)
- On-line tutorials
- Discussions
- Presentations
- Projects
- Seminars (guest lectures)
- Other


## Course Goals

- **Navigate biological databases** - access the wealth of publically available scientific knowledge and data (e.g. NCBI).
- **Analyze Big Data** - e.g. plot and interpret results from next generation sequencing (NGS) experiment.
- **Gain skills in computational and bioinformatics data analysis** - e.g. web-based platforms or command-line bioingofmatics tools (e.g. Galaxy, R).
- **Practice the scientific process and critical thinking** -  learing to read and evaluate scientific literature, ask questions, identify avenues for research, design experiments, analyze and interpret data, and integrating results into the broader scientific discourse.
- **Engage in scientific research** - Apply knowledge and skills learned to complete a project using existing datasets to ask new questions, generate novel conclusions and create and present a Final Poster.


### Vision and Change

This course supports the change in vision of undergraduate science education by teaching through research experience, or Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). 
This CURE is a genomic data science research experience with the curriculum that supports [Vision and Change](https://nabt.org/files/galleries/Vision-and-Change-Final-Report.pdf) national report that aims to improve and modernize undergraduate science education and promote competencies in the practices including:

     - 1: Ability to apply the process of science
     - 2: Ability to use quantitative reasoning
     - 3: Ability to tap into the interdisciplinary nature of science
     - 4: Ability to communicate and collaborate with other disciplines
     - 5: Ability to understand the relationship between science and society
