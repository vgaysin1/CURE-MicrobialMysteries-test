This forum will be the primary place for students, their instructors, and experts to communicate about the student’s research project, professional development opportunities, and more. 1.4.2 Learning Objectives Learn how to post to a discourse community. Examine the differences between private and public discourse categories. 1.4.3 Introduction Before beginning this assignment, you should have already made an account on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum and been added to the course Category by your instructor. Within the C-MOOR community, you will find Categories, which can be either private or public. In this course we will use both. In our private category, students can talk to each other and their instructor and their conversations will not be publicly available. In the public category, students’ posts will be visible on the web. The value of public discourse communities is that you might get responses by experts that you do not know. In this assignment, students will post to both a public and private Category within the Community. 1.4.4 Activity 1 - Create a Topic in a Private Category Estimated time: 20 min 1.4.4.1 Instructions Visit the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum (help.c-moor.org) and log in. It is a good idea to bookmark this page so that you can easily access it throughout the course. Read through the categories in the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum. Notice that some categories (at least one) have a lock next to them. This is a Private category, only visible to you, your classmates and your instructor. If you cannot see your course’s private category when you log in, email your instructor so that they can add you. Click on the private category that belongs to your class: Spring 2025. In this private channel, we will add a “New Topic” in which you can introduce yourself to the class. This first post will be an introduction to your class, including a bit about you and a photo. a. Tell your group about yourself. Answer the following questions. 1. What is your name? 2. Why did you decide to take this class? What are you excited to learn about this semester? 3. Tell us one thing you like to do outside of school and work. b. Include a photo: 1. Selfie: if you would like, post a photo of yourself. 2. Unselfie: or post a photo of something else. Maybe something that you feel represents your life right now, or a picture of something you love. A pet maybe. Just make sure it tells us something about you. Play around with the platform to personalize your post. As you can see in the discourse topic, you can add emojis, upload images, embed content, etc. These features appear in plain text as you’re typing, but you can see a preview of your post on the right. For your first few posts you may see a Welcome Box on the right instead, you can close this to see the preview. Once you have posted a few times, the Welcome Box will stop appearing. When you are done, click “Create Topic” and it will post for the class to see. If other students have posted their introductions, read them and leave a couple replies. This is a discussion platform after all! 1.4.4.2 Resources C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum How to add a bookmark in Chrome Discourse New User Guide 1.4.5 Activity 2 - Reply to a Topic in a Public Category Estimated time: 10 min 1.4.5.1 Instructions Navigate back to the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum front page.

(pubmed.gov/19146522) 2.2.2 Learning Objectives Read a review paper that summarizes the field of metagenomics. Broadly understand the scope of the review and the gaps in the field. 2.2.3 Introduction The vast majority of all micro-organisms on Earch remain uncultured (K.G. Lloyd et al, 2019). Additionally, in complex environments like soil and water, most micro-organisms remain unidentified (M. Delgado-Baquerizo, 2019). The field of metagenomics is a culture-independend approach which aims to remedy these gaps in knowledge (J. Handelsman, 2004). Metagenomics is the study of genomic (sequencing) data obtained directly from environmental (and other, e.g. clinical) samples and provides new meaningful information on the diversity and function of microorganisms. 2.2.4 Activity Estimated time: 50 min 2.2.4.1 Instructions Read the review paper “Metagenomics” by Sleator, Shortall, and Hill, 2008 Lett Appl Microbiol and answer the following questions. 2.2.4.2 Questions What is one thing you learned or find interesting in the paper?

How comparable is your MAG genome to the E. coli genome from the microbial-genomes-pre-lab, in terms of genome size and number of genes? 8. As you can see, MAGs are made up of Contigs. Based on your lecture and reading material, and this exercise, in your own words define MAGs and Contigs below. MAGs: Contigs: 3.4.3.4 Activity 1 - Part II - Explore a Contig 3.4.3.5 Instructions MAGs are made up of Contigs. To see which contigs make up your MAG, go back to GenBank https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/, and search for your MAG using its GenBank ID (e.g.GCF_030147545.1). You will see that MAG GCF_030147545.1 is composed of 42 contigs: 1. Each contig has its own accession number. Choose a contig of reasonably large size (&gt; 75 kb), click on the contig, then find and record below the Contig’s ID (Accession number/GenBank ID) for further examination. Tip: You can sort the entries by length via’ Sort by Sequence Length’ on top! For the contig you chose in activity above, under Related Information on the right, click on Taxonomy and then click again on the provided link. Find Lineage information. Full Lineage information contains 7 core taxonomy ranks: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species, plus any additional classification ranks. To just get the 7 core lineage names, click on Lineage link for the abbreviated Lineage, or, simply hover over lineage names. 2. Record 7 core taxonomy ranks for your Contig. Kingdom: Phylum: Class: Order: Family: Genus: Species: 3.4.3.6 Activity 1 - Part III - Visualize contig in a tree of life 3.4.3.7 Introduction Use Lifemap to visually explore the contig taxonomy in the context of the tree of life. Go to https://lifemap-ncbi.univ-lyon1.fr and enter the lowest taxonomy rank observed for your contig (most likely the species or genus level, but can also correspond to order or family). On the tree map, use plus and minus tabs to zoom in and out and visualize your Contig entry relative to other organisms on the map. Zoom in and find nodes corresponding to the higher taxonomic ranks. For example, if your contig corresponds to genus level classification, you will not be able to identify species level information, but you will be able to identify the corresponding Family, Order, Class and Phylum. 1. Record 7 core taxonomy ranks for your Contig. Kingdom: Phylum: Class: Order: Family: Genus: Species: 2. What are some other members of the Genus to which your Contig belongs? 3. What are some other members of the Family to which your Contig belongs? 4. What are some other members of the Order to which your Contig belongs? 5.

Compare kraken2 output for Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard and Zymo Human Fecal Reference. Introduce concepts of taxa and relationships, begin forming data analysis goals like comparing how many species, most abundant species, etc. See accompanying slides. 4.1.2 Learning Objectives Explore taxonomy with Kraken 2 taxonomic assignment output. Compare and contrast taxonomy between Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard and Zymo Human Fecal Reference. 4.1.3 Introduction Metagenomics is the direct analysis of the genomes through genome sequencing of an environmental sample (soil, water, gut, etc). The purpose of the taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences is to catalogue, classify and identify the species inhabiting a given environment. In the process, new species may get identified! After sampling, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing and genome assembly, genome annotation is used to assign taxonomy to the sequenced sample DNA. Here is where the Kraken 2 tool comes in; Kraken 2 is a taxonomic classification tool which assigns taxonomy to sequencing reads. 4.1.4 Activity 1 – Explore Zymo Gut Standard Metagenomic Diversity Estimated time: 25 min 4.1.4.1 Instructions Perform the activity below and answer the embedded questions. Access tax-data-gut.tsv and open with Google Sheets here Identify what information is provided in columns of the tax-data-gut taxonomy file. Col A = Counts Cols B-H correspond to taxonomic ranks k(Kingdom), p(Phylum), c(Class), o(Order), f(Family), g(Genus) and s(Species) Each row corresponds to a different taxa. There are 153 taxa that were classified for this sample. Create a header row and enter column information. 4.1.4.2 Questions 1. Evaluate what proportion of data was taxonomically classified. Insert a new column A; we will use this temporary column for calculations, so you can name this column “Calculations”. In e.g. cell A2, calculate the sum of all reads observed in the gut std sample. 1A. How many total counts are there? In e.g. cell A3, determine the percentage of unclassified reads. 1B. What percentage of reads are unclassified? In e.g. cell A4, determine the percentage of classified reads. 1C. What percentage of reads are classified? 2. Identify abundant taxa (those at &gt;1%). Select columns B through I In the Data menu, select “Sort range by column B (Z to A)” Insert a new column C; we will use this temporary column for calculations; you can name this column “% abundance”. In new column C, calculate % abundance for each row by dividing each count value by the total number of reads and multiplying by 100. Quantify abundant taxa. 2A. How many abundant taxa (at &gt;1%) do you observe? List abundant taxa you identified in a table below. To consolidate the different abundant taxa, in e.g. new column D, copy the lower taxonomic rank identified for the abundant (at &gt;1%) taxa. Then, enter the results into a table below. 3A. What abundant taxa do you observe? % abundance Taxonomy 20.1 s_Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii 4. Compare your results with the expected taxa and abundance for Zymo gut standard documentation?

To ensure high-quality sequence input, QC (and in many cases also read trimming and filtering) are routinely performed on raw sequences. The reads can then be used to determine which species, genera, families, and other taxonomic ranks are present in the sample. To assign taxonomy, we can compare the reads of the sample to a reference database, i.e. sequences of known microorganisms stored in a database, using Kraken2, which is a k-mer based taxonomic assignment tool. We can then use a tool like Krona to interactively visualize and explore the composition of a metagenome. 4.3.4 Activity 1 – QC Reads Estimated time: 50 min 4.3.4.1 Activity 1 - Part I - Import dataset into Galaxy Estimated time: 15 min 4.3.4.2 Instructions Import dataset into Galaxy.

Accurate and continuous genome assembly from sequenced fragments, even very long fragments, is challenging. Flye, is a long-read assembly algorithm that aims to produce highly contiguous genome assemblies and overcome some of the assembly challenges, like repetitive DNA sequences. Using Flye we will hope to be able to reconstruct bacterial genomes and plasmids and enable detection of important genes like AMRs. Ideally, after assembly we want to get back circular contigs as that would typically indicate an entire microbial genome(s) or plasmid(s). Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microbes to evade one or more antibiotics, leading to multidrug resistance and ability to survive and even thrive in the presence of antibiotics. Detecting and studying antibiotic-resistant pathogens is therefore extremely important to human health. However, the environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood. Certainly the indiscriminate and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics by humans (e.g. in the hospitals, in food production) has contributed to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, but there are many other ways microbes can acquire AMR. For example, the environment like soil is emerging as a key reservoir of these antibiotic resistance genes. For more information on AMRs see the following review articles: 10.1038/nrmicro2312 and 10.3390/antibiotics13121112.

You will also explore information about the taxonomic classifier GTDB-Tk. This will allow you to compare genomic assemblies and AMRs between soil and Zymo gut standard. 5.4.2 Learning Objectives Use Galaxy tools to Use Flye tool to perform de novo genome assembly of long reads into ‘contigs’ Visualize the contigs with Bandage visualization tool Use ABRicate tool to find AMRs in contig assemblies Use MetaBAT2 to bin contigs into larger MAGs Learn about GTDB-Tk taxonomy classifier tool 5.4.3 Introduction In this activity we will practice de novo genome assembly with Flye, using soil metagenomes from Nanopore sequencing . You will have an opportunity to compare and contrast assembled contigs and antimicrobial resistance profiles of soil and gut and think about the differences and similarities in microbial diversity of the two environments. In this project you will also learn about MetaBAT2 and GTDB-Tk. Let’s start now. The most up to date long read metagenomics workflow includes contig assembly (e.g. using Flye tool), followed by contig binning into larger metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) (with e.g. MetaBAT2 tool) and finally MAG classification (e.g. with GTDB-Tk). MetaBAT2 is an algorithm that bins (or groups) sequence fragments (contigs) into larger MAGs or draft genomes. Subsequently, MAGs can be taxonomically classified by GTDB-Tk. You will not be executing GTDB-Tk in this activity to stay within a reasonable activity time frame. However, for your project work, you will have a chance to test GTDB-Tk on your genome assemblies and bins. A note to your future self working on a project - as a rule, after genome assembly, if your contigs are 500 kb or above, they will be considered large enough to be passed to GTDB-Tk without the need for binning. Contigs of &lt; 500 kb will be binned and passed on to GTDB-Tk for taxonomy classification as bins. Table of approximate minimum times for a job to be completed on Galaxy using specified tools. Note, these times apply only to the specific input file we will be using in this activity, the nanopore-soil-subset that is 5.4 GB Flye Bandage ABRicate MetaBAT2 5 hours &lt; 5 min &lt; 10 min &lt; 10 min 5.4.4 Activity 1 – Genome assembly with Flye Estimated time: 30 min (activity time DOES NOT include the Flye run time on Galaxy) 5.4.4.1 Instructions Run Flye in Galaxy on quality filtered (with fastp tool) nanopore soil pilot subset nanopore-soil-subset-filtered to de novo assemble soil microbial genomes.

How many contigs were assembled? Note: Since each contig is represented by a separate row (or line) in the assembly info file, simply clicking on the assembly info file and recording the number of lines listed in the file will correspond to the number of contigs 2. What is the longest contig size? 3. What percent of input was assembled into contigs? - Note 1: Based on the log file, the input going into flye assembly was 6,103,654,873 bases. - Note 2: Based on the log file, the output going of flye assembly was 154,251,885 bases. 4. Why do you think only a small fraction of reads was assembled into contigs? 5. Compare soil assembly to the Zymo gut standard assembly provided the following observations: For this activity you can consult back to your Prelab: Finding AMRs. The number of contigs assembled from 339.9 MB of sequencing data from the Zymo gut standard D6331 subset was 265, much smaller than for the filtered soil sample of 5.4 GB! Yet, the largest contig size for the Zymo gut standard was 2,158,044 (almost 9 times larger) and circular (while the largest contig for the soil sample was linear). 5A. Why do you think the number of contigs in the soil sample was so much higher than the number of contigs in the Zymo gut standard? - Hint 1 - it is NOT because of the difference in the size of the sequencing file. - Hint 2 - Think about possible differences in the microbial diversity of the two samples. 5B. Why do you think it was possible to assemble a much larger and circular contig with the Zymo gut standard sample compared to the soil sample? 5.4.5 Activity 2 – Contig visualization with Bandage Estimated time: 15 min 5.4.5.1 Instructions Run Bandage Image tool in Galaxy to visualize contigs.

We chose a poster as our final deliverable in C-MOOR because they: Facilitate participation in research symposiums: Students can use their poster to apply to present at research symposiums or conferences with minimal additional effort beyond what they do in class. If your institution does not have a research day, consider starting one using these posters as a foundation as we did at Clovis Community College! Your school’s library is another great point of contact in getting a poster session or research day set up. Serve as a physical representation of student achievement: If printed, once finished with the class, students can choose to take their poster with them or leave it with the class to be hung up around the classroom or the hallways. This gives their research project more visibility, serves as an advertisement for other students who might be interested in taking the class, and showcases what students have accomplished. Can easily be shared digitally: A presentation can’t be repeated twice without a recording, and each recording can take up a lot of digital storage. A poster on the other hand, is a great compressed product that can be posted on a student’s (or the institution’s) social media and help get their work seen by others. Posters are even small enough that they can be attached to an email and sent to prospective supervisors and collaborators interested in a quick summary of their work. See our Look at This! category on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum to see all the posters students have created and shared so far! Posters can be used to measure student achievement and understanding: We have previously used these posters to evaluate student learning, even years after students have left the classroom.

This might be in the form of a peer-reviewed journal article or a more informal poster presentation at a conference or symposium. In this assignment, students will work with their groups to put together their work from the C-MOOR Labs into a research poster. Although the same information is in a poster, presentation, and a paper, each format requires a vastly different approach! Here’s an example of a poster, a presentation, and a paper all from the same study. Notice how they all contain different levels of detail, different numbers of figures, and use language aimed for a specific audience. Your poster should look distinct from your presentation or paper. 10.3.2 Part 1 - Choose a Template Estimated time: 5 minutes With your group, open a suggested poster template to use for your poster. Discuss with your group how you will divide up the work and exchange important information (e.g. phone numbers, email). Consider the following sections: Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion References Acknowledgments Notice these posters are sized at 36 x 42 inches, but there are many other commonly used sizes. Refer to your instructor on what poster size to use; not every poster will fit every stand when printed (if applicable). Notice that the posters in this slidedeck come in two-column, three-column, and mixed formats. Think about your figures and tables and select a format that makes the most sense for them. There are also some example posters in the last two slides that we will use to examine the anatomy of a research poster further in the next part. 10.3.3 Part 2 - Make an Academic Research Poster Estimated time: — Complete the following components of your research poster with your group. You might not do them in this order, but these are the components you are being graded on. For more details on each of these sections and their role in a scientific paper, see the Scientific Literature Lab. 10.3.3.1 The header: title, authors, and affiliations Since you completed this work as a team of scientists, all of your team members are considered authors. List your team members in alphabetical order. The author’s affiliation is the university, college, research institution or company that the work was conducted at. An example affiliation for Clovis Community College would be: “Department of Biology, Clovis Community College, California, United States.” If multiple institutions exist, you will need to use superscript to denote who has what affiliation (see the example poster). We will include the C-MOOR logo, the logo of your institution(s), and the most immediately relevant funding source (if applicable) in the header. Check the header of your poster:  All authors are listed  The affiliations of all authors are listed  The C-MOOR logo is included  The logos of your institutions are included  The title of the poster is focused on your specific project topic (ex. genes, variables, model organism)  The title of the poster describes the main result of your research  The title of the poster does not overstate the findings or significance of your research 10.3.3.2 Abstract An abstract is a concise summary of your paper. An effective abstract will inform the reader of the scientific hypothesis being tested, the purpose of the study, the main methods, and the most important results and conclusions. You may notice that not all posters online contain and abstract; different fields of science have slightly different requirements and formats for abstracts. Your abstract should do the following:  1 sentence on why your research matters  1 sentence summarizing your methodology  1-2 sentence with the main results without interpretation (ex. we found that gene X was differentially abundant between the eye and all other tissues; we found an association between age and the presence of Y bacteria)  1 sentence on what new knowledge you have contributed from your research (ex. gene X plays a key role in the eye, Y bacteria which is associated with function Z is associated with older populations)  The abstract is no longer than 200 words; no unnecessary words are included 10.3.3.3 Introduction A good introduction section should do two things. First, it provides context for your work by describing what is already known in the field, as well as an unknown that your research is addressing. The latter is often called the gap in knowledge. Second, it should identify your scientific question and hypothesis. Usually, the introduction starts broadly, describing the work of other scientists. It is important to summarize this work (do not quote) and to properly cite the work. When writing your introduction, it is often helpful to start at the end. Identify your scientific question, your hypothesis and the gap of knowledge first. Then brainstorm what you will need to tell your readers in terms of context and background. Check your poster’s introduction: The introduction contains:  Why your research is novel  Why your research matters (ex. any relevant disease states)  The aim and/or hypotheses of your research  Information on why the model organism used is a good model (if relevant to your project) Check that:  The introduction is brief (ex. no more than 200 words)  The introduction is formatted in bullet points, not paragraphs  All statements that require references have an in-line reference 10.3.3.4 Materials and Methods The materials and methods section will detail your analysis of the data. Don’t provide any of your results, just the methods. If you did not generate the data yourself from raw samples, you will simply cite the paper that made them instead of detailing their construction. We will also need to list any programs we used and provide credit to their creators. Some other things you might include would be what type of analysis you decided to do (which parts of the body parts you analyzed, sets of genes, what p-value you used, etc.). Check your poster’s materials and methods section:  You have listed the source of your data (ex. the published study your data came from) and added the appropriate in-line citation  You have listed all R packages and/or websites you used (ex. DESeq2, ClustrProfiler, Phyloseq, FlyBase, Human Protein Atlas, CellxGene) and added the appropriate in-line citation  You list what p-value you tested for significance at (usually 0.05)  Another student from your class would be able to replicate your research based on what you wrote 10.3.3.5 Results The Results section is where you will detail your data primarily through figures and tables, though sometimes written text is included. Begin by creating your tables and figures. Place the figures and tables in order of how you want to present them and name them such as Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc. Every figure and table must have a legend that goes with it in a smaller font. Figures have their legends underneath them. Tables have their figures above them. These legends should be in a smaller font than the rest of the text on the poster. Each legend begins with 1 sentence summarizing the takeaway idea from the figure/table. If necessary, add 1-2 sentences of detail on the context and/or methodology used to generate the figure or table to give context to the audience on what they are looking at. If you are including written text of your results, you should go through each figure in order, emphasizing any important results from each one. As you discuss each figure, you will reference the figure or table in parentheses. For example: “RT-PCR analysis shows an increase in gene expression for gene X (Fig 2).” Have fun playing around with how to organize your figures with the text to make the poster look professional. You need a minimum of 2 figures for your poster. Check your poster’s results section:  You have a minimum of 2 figures on the poster  All figures have a labeled x and y-axis  All figures have a legend underneath them  All tables have a legend above them  The legends have 1 sentence summarizing the figure or table’s main idea  If necessary, the legends have 1-2 sentences detailing the methodology and or other context of the figure/table 10.3.3.6 Discussion The discussion section of the paper is your chance to analyze and interpret your results. For your lab report, make sure your discussion section includes all of the following: What do your results mean? How do they fit into the bigger picture? If any experiments did not give expected results, hypothesize why that might have been the case and propose alternate experiments that could confirm or clarify your results. Include at least one sentence of future work that you would do if you had more time or what students in upcoming semesters could do to continue to answer your questions. Check your poster’s discussion section:  1 sentence for each major result that relates to your hypothesis  1-2 sentences how these results matter based on the problem you described in your introduction  1 sentence describing future work someone else could do as a logical next step in addressing the problem you described in your introduction  If your results were unexpected, hypothesize why that might be the case 10.3.3.7 References All the references that you cite on your poster must be present in a References section including the following sections: Introduction, Methods, and Discussion. To save space on our posters, we will number our references (ex. 1-5) and use the numbers as citations throughout the text of your poster. You may have a lot of references; it is okay to put them in tiny text if you have to in order to make them fit. There are many different ways to format the reference section. We will make ours in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name. All of your sources must be scientific journals and should use the following format: Authors (year) “Title.” Journal Name, vol. #, page #s, DOI Online article that is also in print: Haussecker D., Huang Y., Lau A., Parameswaran P., Fire A. Z. and M. A. Kay (2010) “Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.” RNA, Vol. 16, page 637-695, doi:10.1261/rna.2000810 Online article only: Marianes, A. and A. C. Spradling (2013) “Physiological and stem cell compartmentalization within the Drosophila midgut.” eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.00886 Check your references section:  All in-text citations in the introduction are included in the references  All in-text citations in the methods are included in the references  All in-text citations in the discussion are included in the references  All references are from scientific journals  All text that requires an in-text citation has one 10.3.3.8 Acknowledgements The acknowledgements section is where you give thanks to the people, organizations, and institutions that have supported you in your research. If relevant, include the grant ID # of your funding source. Institutions and organizations that have contributed to your research - but you do not belong to - can be thanked here. Check your acknowledgements section: Thank any funding source and the grant # are listed here Thank your research mentor (if applicable) Thank those who have provided you with technical support (if applicable) 10.3.4 Part 3 - Proofread and Add Final Touches Estimated time: 30 min to an hour Each group member should re-read the poster from beginning to end and fix any typos or grammatical errors. Check the alignment of figures, text boxes, titles, etc. Add some finishing touches. You can play with the color, the font, add additional images if it’s relevant. 10.3.5 Part 4 - Canvas Discussion Estimated time: 30 min You will turn in your poster to be graded as a group in a Canvas Assignment and post it to a Canvas Discussion to be viewed by the class. Convert your poster to a pdf. Have one member of your group turn in the pdf of your poster to the Graded Canvas Assignment. This assignment is already set up so that if one group member turns it in, it will show as submitted for all students in the group. This is where your instructor will grade you poster as a group. Have one member of your group post a pdf of your poster in the Canvas C-MOOR Poster Discussion. With your poster, introduce your group members and copy and paste your abstract into the post. Insert your pdf into the post and edit the link so that it automatically shows the inline preview. This will make it easier for students to view your poster. As an individual, read through the other posters from different groups. Post comments 10.3.6 Grading Criteria Everyone in the group earns the same grade, so it is important to work together.
