This forum will be the primary place for students, their instructors, and experts to communicate about the student’s research project, professional development opportunities, and more. 1.4.2 Learning Objectives Learn how to post to a discourse community. Examine the differences between private and public discourse categories. 1.4.3 Introduction Before beginning this assignment, you should have already made an account on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum and been added to the course Category by your instructor. Within the C-MOOR community, you will find Categories, which can be either private or public. In this course we will use both. In our private category, students can talk to each other and their instructor and their conversations will not be publicly available. In the public category, students’ posts will be visible on the web. The value of public discourse communities is that you might get responses by experts that you do not know. In this assignment, students will post to both a public and private Category within the Community. 1.4.4 Activity 1 - Create a Topic in a Private Category Estimated time: 20 min 1.4.4.1 Instructions Visit the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum (help.c-moor.org) and log in. It is a good idea to bookmark this page so that you can easily access it throughout the course. Read through the categories in the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum. Notice that some categories (at least one) have a lock next to them. This is a Private category, only visible to you, your classmates and your instructor. If you cannot see your course’s private category when you log in, email your instructor so that they can add you. Click on the private category that belongs to your class: Spring 2025. In this private channel, we will add a “New Topic” in which you can introduce yourself to the class. This first post will be an introduction to your class, including a bit about you and a photo. Tell your group about yourself. Answer the following questions. What is your name? Why did you decide to take this class? What are you excited to learn about this semester? Tell us one thing you like to do outside of school and work. Include a photo:. Selfie: if you would like, post a photo of yourself. Unselfie: or post a photo of something else. Maybe something that you feel represents your life right now, or a picture of something you love. A pet maybe. Just make sure it tells us something about you. Play around with the platform to personalize your post. As you can see in the discourse topic, you can add emojis, upload images, embed content, etc. These features appear in plain text as you’re typing, but you can see a preview of your post on the right. For your first few posts you may see a Welcome Box on the right instead, you can close this to see the preview. Once you have posted a few times, the Welcome Box will stop appearing. When you are done, click “Create Topic” and it will post for the class to see. If other students have posted their introductions, read them and leave a couple replies. This is a discussion platform after all! 1.4.4.2 Resources C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum How to add a bookmark in Chrome Discourse New User Guide 1.4.5 Activity 2 - Reply to a Topic in a Public Category Estimated time: 10 min 1.4.5.1 Instructions Navigate back to the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum front page. Click on the “Breakroom” Category. This is an informal category where we can chat about non-science related topics. Look for a topic called “Enduring a Snow Storm” Click on the topic. Read the topic and then click “Reply”. The same box will pop up as you used to to post a topic earlier. Write a reply to the topic. When you are finished click “Reply” to post. 1.4.5.2 Resources C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum Discourse New User Guide 1.4.5.3 Grading Criteria Submit URL to your Private Category Topic on Canvas 1.4.5.4 Footnotes Contributions and Affiliations Katherine Cox, Johns Hopkins University Valeriya Gaysinskaya, Johns Hopkins University Frederick Tan, Johns Hopkins University Stephanie Coffman, Clovis Community College Last Revised: January 2025 "],["scientific-literature.html", "Chapter 2 Scientific Literature ", " Chapter 2 Scientific Literature "],["lecture-whats-in-your-xyz.html", "2.1 Lecture: What’s in Your XYZ?", " 2.1 Lecture: What’s in Your XYZ?

Compare kraken2 output for Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard and Zymo Human Fecal Reference. Introduce concepts of taxa and relationships, begin forming data analysis goals like comparing how many species, most abundant species, etc. See accompanying slides. 2.2.2 Learning Objectives Explore taxonomy with Kraken 2 taxonomic assignment output. Compare and contrast taxonomy between Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard and Zymo Human Fecal Reference. 2.2.3 Introduction Metagenomics is the direct analysis of the genomes through genome sequencing of an environmental sample (soil, water, gut, etc). The purpose of the taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences is to catalogue, classify and identify the species inhabiting a given environment. In the process, new species may get identified! After sampling, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing and genome assembly, genome annotation is used to assign taxonomy to the sequenced sample DNA. Here is where the Kraken 2 tool comes in; Kraken 2 is a taxonomic classification tool which assigns taxonomy to sequencing reads. 2.2.4 Activity 1 – Explore Zymo Gut Standard Metagenomic Diversity Estimated time: 25 min 2.2.4.1 Instructions Perform the activity below and answer the embedded questions. Access tax-data-gut.tsv and open with Google Sheets here Identify what information is provided in columns of the tax-data-gut taxonomy file. Col A = Counts Cols B-H correspond to taxonomic ranks k(Kingdom), p(Phylum), c(Class), o(Order), f(Family), g(Genus) and s(Species) Each row corresponds to a different taxa. There are 153 taxa that were classified for this sample. Create a header row and enter column information. 2.2.4.2 Questions Evaluate what proportion of data was taxonomically classified. Insert a new column A; we will use this temporary column for calculations, so you can name this column “Calculations”. In e.g. cell A2, calculate the sum of all reads observed in the gut std sample. How many total counts are there? In e.g. cell A3, determine the percentage of unclassified reads. What percentage of reads are unclassified? In e.g. cell A4, determine the percentage of classified reads. What percentage of reads are classified? Identify abundant taxa (those at &gt;1%). Select columns B through I In the Data menu, select “Sort range by column B (Z to A)” Insert a new column C; we will use this temporary column for calculations; you can name this column “% abundance”. In new column C, calculate % abundance for each row by dividing each count value by the total number of reads and multiplying by 100. Quantify abundant taxa. How many abundant taxa (at &gt;1%) do you observe? List abundant taxa you identified in a table below. To consolidate the different abundant taxa, in e.g. new column D, copy the lower taxonomic rank identified for the abundant (at &gt;1%) taxa. Then, enter the results into a table below. What abundant taxa do you observe? % abundance Taxonomy 20.1 s_Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii Compare your results with the expected taxa and abundance for Zymo gut standard documentation? Note, the Kraken2 output does not distinguish different E. coli strains, so just combine them all into a single E. coli group! How do your results overall compare with the expected taxa and % abundance from Zymo gut standard? Calculate ‘Low abundance’ for &lt; 1% abundant taxa by adding together taxa at &lt;1%. What percentage of reads are classified in a low abundance taxa? Create a barplot of % abundance for your 12 abundant taxa via Insert Chart. Paste your barplot of % abundance for the 12 most abundant taxa 2.2.5 Activity 2 (OPTIONAL) – Compare with Zymo Fecal Reference Estimated time: 20 min 2.2.5.1 Instructions Perform the optional activity below and answer the embedded questions. In this activity, repeat steps of the Activity 1 above, but now using tax_data_fecal.tsv dataset corresponding to Zymo fecal reference. The tax_data_fecal.tsv dataset comes from a real human fecal sample, in contrast to the tax_data_gut.tsv sample you explored in the Activity 1, which corresponds to cultured and pooled known species combined at specific proportions to make up a predictable standard population. Perform Activity 1 exercises using tax_data_fecal data, then, use questions below to compare the two datasets. See D6323 Zymo Fecal Microbiome References documentation (pg. 4) in the Resources section below. 2.2.5.2 Questions 1. Which dataset is classified better, gut or fecal?? 2. Are there any abundant taxa (at &gt;1%) in common between the gut standard and fecal reference? 3. In your opinion, does the gut standard mimic the fecal reference well or not? 2.2.6 Grading Criteria Download this assignment as Microsoft Word (.docx) and upload on Canvas Download your Google Sheet as Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) and upload on Canvas 2.2.7 Footnotes Resources Google Doc D6331 Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard documentation D6323 Zymo Fecal Microbiome References documentation Contributions and Affiliations Valeriya Gaysinskaya, Johns Hopkins University Gauri Paul, Clovis Community College Frederick Tan, Johns Hopkins University Last Revised: January 2025 "],["activity-a-short-introduction-to-galaxy.html", "2.3 Activity: A short introduction to Galaxy", " 2.3 Activity: A short introduction to Galaxy 2.3.1 Introduction Galaxy galaxyproject.org is a free, open-source system for analyzing data, authoring workflows, training and education, publishing tools, managing infrastructure, and more.

Sleator, C. Shortall, and C. Hill. Metagenomics. Letters in Applied Microbiology. 2008 Nov;47(5):361-6. (pubmed.gov/19146522) 2.4.2 Learning Objectives Read a review paper that summarizes the field of metagenomics. Broadly understand the scope of the review and the gaps in the field. 2.4.3 Introduction The vast majority of all micro-organisms on Earch remain uncultured (K.G. Lloyd et al, 2019). Additionally, in complex environments like soil and water, most micro-organisms remain unidentified (M. Delgado-Baquerizo, 2019). The field of metagenomics is a culture-independend approach which aims to remedy these gaps in knowledge (J. Handelsman, 2004). Metagenomics is the study of genomic (sequencing) data obtained directly from environmental (and other, e.g. clinical) samples and provides new meaningful information on the diversity and function of microorganisms. 2.4.4 Activity Estimated time: 50 min 2.4.4.1 Instructions Read the review paper “Metagenomics” by Sleator, Shortall, and Hill, 2008 Lett Appl Microbiol and answer the following questions. 2.4.4.2 Questions What is one thing you learned or find interesting in the paper?
