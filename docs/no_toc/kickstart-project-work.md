## Project Work Organizer

### Purpose: Kickstart Project Work

The purpose of kickstart project work is to gain practice in scientific exploration and research, communication, and work on your scientific poster! A few ideas to get you started can be found in the **Possible Datasets** Lecture and Acvitivity below.

### Purpose: Project Work Organizer

Research lab meetings are great forums to receive community analysis and feedback.  Many classes going forward will be spent discussing your project progress, alternating between data results and troubleshooting methods.  Refer to this organizer to see what we’ll discuss on a given day and find the appropriate slidedeck.  The slidedeck for the final poster presentation is also linked for April 22nd.

### Organizer: In Class Round Table Data and Troubleshooting

1. The Project Work phase contains many elements to scaffold your research as you progress towards a final poster presentation.  These include round table updates, written check-ins, advisory meetings, and peer reviews. 
2. Use this organizer to find instructions and track documents.

a. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - Round Table Data for all groups
b. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - Round Table Troubleshooting  for all groups
c. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - Poster for all groups
