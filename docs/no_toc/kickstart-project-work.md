## Activity: Possible Datasets

### Activity

*Estimated time: 50 min*

#### Instructions

1. Skim three abstracts

2. Pick one and answer the following questions

a) Notice – What about this abstract most interests you?

b) Dataset – Summarize at a high level where the samples came from, how many there are, and what technology was used for sequencing.

c) Wonder – Two or three questions you would like to ask using this (and any other) datasets.

3. Post your answers by replying to the “Project Work: Possible Datasets” topic in the Discussion Forum

## Project Work Organizer

### Purpose: 

**Kickstart Project Work** - The purpose of kickstart project work is to gain practice in scientific exploration and research, communication, and work on your scientific poster! A few ideas to get you started can be found in the **Possible Datasets** Lecture and Acvitivity below.

**Project Work Organizer** - Research lab meetings are great forums to receive community analysis and feedback.  Many classes going forward will be spent discussing your project progress, alternating between data results and troubleshooting methods.  Refer to this organizer to see what we’ll discuss on a given day and find the appropriate slidedeck.  The slidedeck for the final poster presentation is also linked for April 22nd.

### Organizer: In Class Round Table Data and Troubleshooting

1. The Project Work phase contains many elements to scaffold your research as you progress towards a final poster presentation.  These include round table updates, written check-ins, advisory meetings, and peer reviews. 
2. Use this organizer to find instructions and track documents related to in-class updates.

a. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Round Table Data** for all groups
b. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Round Table Troubleshooting**  for all groups
c. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Poster** for all groups
d. Instructor will create a single Slidedeck - **Final Presentation** for all groups

3. See sample organizer below for your Project Work updates.

|Course Week | Day 1 | Day 2

### Organizer:  Individual Group Information

1. The Project Work phase contains many elements to scaffold your research as you progress towards a final poster presentation.  These include round table updates, written check-ins, advisory meetings, and peer reviews. 
2. Use this organizer to find instructions and track documents.

3. For each group, instructor will create a text **Doc** which will include the following sections:

a. **Written Check-in** - Progress will be assessed through several written check-ins.  These documents will allow you to summarize the work you’ve done, receive feedback from colleagues, and provide another opportunity to ask for help.  Your check-in should be concise but complete (full sentences) and include the following information:

- New progress since last submission (15 pts)
- How you’ve addressed prior feedback (15 pts)
- Poster organization (10 pts)
- Struggles you are encountering and questions you would like advice on (10 pts)

b. **Written Check-in (Poster)** - The second written check-in will focus on starting your poster using material you developed for your Round Table updates.  Posters should be 30 inches wide and we have provided a template with example two and three column formats.  You can make your own design by selecting the Blank layout.  Kickstart your poster by adding the following details:

- Title and authors (10 pts)
- Hypothesis along with diagram or figure (10 pts)
- Dataset table with sample metadata including accession ID, collection method, etc. (10 pts)
- Methods in the form of details and figure (10 pts)
- Results (10 pts)

c. **Peer Review** - Each person will work individually to peer review two separate projects.  Review the poster associated with each project and provide feedback in their Check-in document on the following:

- Aspects of the project that you find fascinating
- Questions you have about the approach or results
- Suggestions on next steps, poster organization, etc.

4. For each group, instructor will create a Slidedeck for Final Presentation Slides - **Slides**

a. Each group will present their capstone project during an in-class poster presentation.  Posters are due one week before on April 14th to provide sufficient time for printing.


5. **Advisory Meeting** - Each group will schedule a meeting with the instructors to discuss their progress.  These meetings will take place outside of class and should be scheduled before the deadline.  A link to the when2meet schedule can be found in the Group Information section.

6. See sample organizer below for your Project Work updates.

|Group | Check-in | Poster | Meeting #1 | Meeting # 2|
|:--| :--| :-- | :-- | :-- | 
|Group A| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
|Group B| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
|Group C| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2| 
|Group D| Doc | Slides | Date 1 | Date 2|
