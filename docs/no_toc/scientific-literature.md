## Activity: Taxonomy Profiling Spreadsheet

## Activity: A short introduction to Galaxy

## Homework: Pre-lab: Scientific Literature 

### Purpose 

Obtain a high level overview of metagenomics by reading
R.D. Sleator, C. Shortall, and C. Hill.  Metagenomics.  Letters in Applied Microbiology. 2008 Nov;47(5):361-6. [(pubmed.gov/19146522)](http://pubmed.gov/19146522)

### Learning Objectives 

- Read a review paper that summarizes the field of metagenomics.
- Broadly understand the scope of the review and the gaps in the field. 

### Introduction 

The vast majority of all micro-organisms on Earch remain uncultured [(K.G. Lloyd et al, 2019)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00055-18). Additionally, in complex environments like soil and water, most micro-organisms remain unidentified [(M. Delgado-Baquerizo, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-019-0405-0). The field of metagenomics is a culture-independend approach which aims to remedy these gaps in knowledge [(J. Handelsman, 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590779/). Metagenomics is the study of genomic (sequencing) data obtained directly from environmental (and other, e.g. clinical) samples and provides new meaningful information on the diversity and function of microorganisms.


### Activity

*Estimated time: 50 min*

#### Instructions

Read the review paper “Metagenomics” by Sleator, Shortall, and Hill, 2008 Lett Appl Microbiol and answer the following questions.

#### Questions

1. What is one thing you learned or find interesting in the paper?

2. Define a term that is new to you (e.g. metagenome, microbiome, 16S rRNA).

3. Ask a question about the review paper.


#### Grading Criteria

Download as Microsoft Word (.docx) and upload on Canvas
