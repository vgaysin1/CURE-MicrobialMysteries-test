# Scientific Posters

In this section we will go over how to create a scientific poster. We chose a poster as our final deliverable in C-MOOR because they:


- **Facilitate participation in research symposiums**: Students can use their poster to apply to present at research symposiums or conferences with minimal additional effort beyond what they do in class. If your institution does not have a research day, consider starting one using these posters as a foundation as we did at Clovis Community College! Your school's library is another great point of contact in getting a poster session or research day set up. Some of the events students have participated in using their C-MOOR projects include:

  - The Clovis Community College Research Day
  - The Notre Dame of Maryland University Research Day
  - The GRADS-4C Conference (2025)

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI8-_iVqbkzNMf11M4dK85E8ZW3OyZECs_YwMKw5fhs/edit#slide=id.g362974128df_0_0")

```

- **Serve as a physical representation of student achievement**: If printed, once finished with the class, students can choose to take their poster with them or leave it with the class to be hung up around the classroom or the hallways. This gives their research project more visibility, serves as an advertisement for other students who might be interested in taking the class, and showcases what students have accomplished. 


- **Can easily be shared digitally**: A presentation can't be repeated twice without a recording, and each recording can take up a lot of digital storage. A poster on the other hand, is a great compressed product that can be posted on a student's (or the institution's) social media and help get their work seen by others. Posters are even small enough that they can be attached to an email and sent to prospective supervisors and collaborators interested in a quick summary of their work. See our [Look at This!](https://help.c-moor.org/c/look-at-this/) category on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum to see all the posters students have created and shared so far!

- **Posters can be used to measure student achievement and understanding**: We have previously used these posters to evaluate student learning, even years after students have left the classroom.

## Making Group Poster 

### Preparing to make a poster

An important part of scientific research is presenting your findings. Poster is a powerful visual way to communicate new and exciting findings, share ideas and get feedback. No wonder Poster sessions are an integral part of any conference or symposium. Throughout research project work, students will work with their groups to put together a scientific research poster.
 

### Part 1 - Choose a Template
*Estimated time: 5 minutes*

1. With your group, open a suggested [poster template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1chz02nzYklAEjOtHrPsJZccGy1sFUZvqdlfcUyfj3I4/edit?usp=sharing) to use for your poster. 
1. Discuss with your group how you will divide up the work and exchange important information (e.g. phone numbers, email). Consider the following sections: 

- Abstract/Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusions/Discussion
- References 
- Acknowledgments

Notice these posters are sized at 36 x 42 inches, but there are many other commonly used sizes. Refer to your instructor on what poster size to use; not every poster will fit every stand when printed (if applicable). Notice that the posters in this slidedeck come in two-column, three-column, and mixed formats. Think about your figures and tables and select a format that makes the most sense for them. There are also some example posters in the last two slides that we will use to examine the anatomy of a research poster further in the next part.


### Part 2 - Make an Academic Research Poster

*Estimated time: ---*

1. Complete the following components of your research poster with your group. You might not do them in this order, but these are the components you are being graded on. For more details on each of these sections and their role in a scientific paper, see the Scientific Literature Lab.

#### The header: title, authors, and affiliations

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hYKF7Ss3vJ8rrUIH7ByNh1BUlRa2fhsJhq8MXzEowCc/edit?slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_67#slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_67")

```

Since you completed this work as a team of scientists, all of your team members are considered authors. List your team members in alphabetical order. The author’s affiliation is the university, college, research institution or company that the work was conducted at.  

- An example affiliation for Clovis Community College would be: “Department of Biology, Clovis Community College, California, United States.” 
- If multiple institutions exist, you will need to use superscript to denote who has what affiliation (see the example poster).

We will include the C-MOOR logo, the logo of your institution(s), and the most immediately relevant funding source (if applicable) in the header.

<!-- NOTE: &nbsp; creates a space in Markdown. In this instance, adding extra spaces after the checkbox didn't seem to work. -->

**Check the header of your poster:**

- [ ] &nbsp;All authors are listed
- [ ] &nbsp;All authors’ home institutions are referenced
- [ ] &nbsp;The title of the poster is focused on your specific project topic (ex. genes, variables, model organism)

`The title of the poster describes the main result of your research`
`The title of the poster does not overstate the findings or significance of your research`

- [ ] &nbsp;The C-MOOR logo is included
- [ ] &nbsp;The logos of your institutions are included



#### Abstract/Introduction

C-MOOR Abstract/Introduction examples:

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hYKF7Ss3vJ8rrUIH7ByNh1BUlRa2fhsJhq8MXzEowCc/edit?slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_139#slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_139")

```

PacBio's published abstract on 'Genome-resolved metagenome assembly of human oral microbiome using highly accurate long-read sequencing'. 

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hYKF7Ss3vJ8rrUIH7ByNh1BUlRa2fhsJhq8MXzEowCc/edit?slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_149#slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_149")

```

An abstract or introduction is a concise summary of your work. An effective abstract/introduction will inform the reader of the relevant background to the research, scientific hypothesis being tested, the purpose of the study, the main methods, and the most important results and conclusions. You may notice that not all posters online contain and abstract; different fields of science have slightly different requirements and formats for abstracts. 

Abstract is a kind of introduction because it provides context for your work by describing what is already known in the field, as well as an unknown that your research is addressing. The latter is often called the gap in knowledge. 

Abstract can be difficult to write because it combines all research pieces and requires effective and consice communication of those pieces. When writing your abstract/introduction, it may be helpful to start writing at the end. Identify your scientific question, your hypothesis and the gap of knowledge first. Then brainstorm what you will need to tell your readers in terms of context and background. 


**Your Abstract/Introduction should do the following:**

*Include relevant background information such as*: 

```
- A problem or question at hand 
- Model organism used 
- Gene of interest and its function 
- Important associations (e.g. between genotype and phenotype)
- Phenotypes (typical, disease-state) 
- Biological processes
```

*Clearly state hypothesis, and/or objectives of the research*:

`- e.g. Our hypothesis is that the healthy gut microbiome has more microbial diversity than the gut of an individual with a celiac disease.`

or

`- e.g. We hypothesize that maternal antibiotic treatment correlates with higher antibicrobial resistance in infant microbiome.`

also consider:

```
- Why your research is novel
- Why your research matters (ex. any relevant disease states)
```

*Briefly mention methodology you used in your research*

`- e.g. Using Galaxy we analyzed the genomic diversity of the gut microbiome and compared fecal samples between individuals with Celiac Disease (CD) and a control group on a healthy diet without CD.`


*Briefly state your main results without interpretation* 

`- e.g. We found that gene X was differentially abundant between the eye and all other tissues` 

or

`- e.g. We found an association between age and the presence of Y bacteria`

**Check your Abstract/Introduction section:**

- [ ] &nbsp;The appropriate background is given as necessary (3 points)
- [ ] &nbsp;The aim, hypothesis, and/or objectives of the research are stated (1 point)
- [ ] &nbsp;A diagram with legend is included (1 point)
- [ ] &nbsp;In-line citations are included appropriately
- [ ] &nbsp;The abstract text should be no longer than ~200 words


#### Materials and Methods

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI8-_iVqbkzNMf11M4dK85E8ZW3OyZECs_YwMKw5fhs/edit?slide=id.g362974128df_0_27#slide=id.g362974128df_0_27")

```

The materials and methods section will detail your analysis of the data. Don’t provide any of your results, just the methods. If you did not generate the data yourself from raw samples, you will simply cite the paper that made them instead of detailing their construction. We will also need to list any programs we used and provide credit to their creators.

Some other things you might include would be what type of analysis you decided to do (which parts of the body parts you analyzed, sets of genes, what p-value you used, etc.).

**Check your poster's materials and methods section:**

- [ ] &nbsp;You have listed the source of your data (ex. the published study your data came from) and added the appropriate in-line citation
- [ ] &nbsp;You have listed all R packages and/or websites you used (ex. DESeq2, ClustrProfiler, Phyloseq, FlyBase, Human Protein Atlas, CellxGene) and added the appropriate in-line citation
- [ ] &nbsp;If relevant, list what p-value you tested for significance at (usually 0.05)
- [ ] &nbsp;Another student from your class would be able to replicate your research based on what you wrote


#### Results

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hYKF7Ss3vJ8rrUIH7ByNh1BUlRa2fhsJhq8MXzEowCc/edit?slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_6#slide=id.g33d6e3b928f_0_6")

```

The Results section is where you will detail your data primarily through **figures and tables**, though sometimes written text is included. Begin by creating your tables and figures. 

**Figure body**:

- Has high resolution images, well spaced and labeled parts and text. 
- Place the figures and tables in order of how you want to present them and name them such as **Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc**.

**Figure Legend**:

- All figures and tables should have their legends *underneath*.
- The legend should be in a smaller font than the main text on the poster.
- A legend should includes a **figure title**, which is a declarative statement that summarizes  findings.
- A legend also includes **figure text** which a) identifies (and can  briefly describe  parts), b) includes brief description of of methods necessary to understand figure and c) should include relevant statistics (stats).

**Optional text**

- Each Figure and Table can have additional (optional) text.
- Encouraged is a **Section Title** - which summarizes section or figure, similar or broader than figure legend title. Attention Grabber.
- (Optional) text - describes the findings of the figure upfront to engage.

**Check your poster's results section:**

- [ ] &nbsp;You have a minimum of 2 figures on the poster
- [ ] &nbsp;All figures have a labeled x and y-axis
- [ ] &nbsp;All figures have a legend underneath them
- [ ] &nbsp;All tables have a legend above them
- [ ] &nbsp;The legends have 1 sentence summarizing the figure or table's main idea
- [ ] &nbsp;The legends have accompanying text detailing the methodology and or other context of the figure/table.

#### Conclusions/Discussion

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI8-_iVqbkzNMf11M4dK85E8ZW3OyZECs_YwMKw5fhs/edit#slide=id.g362974128df_0_52")

```

The discussion section of the paper is your chance to analyze and interpret your results. For your lab report, make sure your discussion section includes all of the following:

- What do your results mean?
- How do they fit into the bigger picture?
- If any experiments did not give expected results, hypothesize why that might have been the case and propose alternate experiments that could confirm or clarify your results.
- Include at least one sentence of future work that you would do if you had more time or what students in upcoming semesters could do to continue to answer your questions.

**Check your poster's discussion section:**

- [ ] &nbsp;1 sentence for each major result that relates to your hypothesis
- [ ] &nbsp;1-2 sentences how these results matter based on the problem you described in your introduction
- [ ] &nbsp;1 sentence describing future work someone else could do as a logical next step in addressing the problem you described in your introduction
- [ ] &nbsp;If your results were unexpected, hypothesize why that might be the case

#### References

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI8-_iVqbkzNMf11M4dK85E8ZW3OyZECs_YwMKw5fhs/edit#slide=id.g362974128df_0_80")

```

All the references that you cite on your poster must be present in a References section including the following sections: Introduction, Methods, and Discussion. To save space on our posters, we will number our references (ex. 1-5) and use the numbers as citations throughout the text of your poster. You may have a lot of references; it is okay to put them in tiny text if you have to in order to make them fit.

There are many different ways to format the reference section. We will make ours in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name. All of your sources must be scientific journals and should use the following format:

> Authors (year) “Title.” Journal Name, vol. #, page #s, DOI

Online article that is also in print:

> Haussecker D., Huang Y., Lau A., Parameswaran P., Fire A. Z. and M. A. Kay (2010) “Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.” RNA, Vol. 16, page 637-695,  doi:10.1261/rna.2000810

Online article only:

> Marianes, A. and A. C. Spradling (2013) “Physiological and stem cell compartmentalization within the Drosophila midgut.” eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.00886
    
**Check your references section**:

- [ ] &nbsp;All in-text citations in the introduction are included in the references
- [ ] &nbsp;All in-text citations in the methods are included in the references
- [ ] &nbsp;All in-text citations in the discussion are included in the references
- [ ] &nbsp;All references are from scientific journals
- [ ] &nbsp;All text that requires an in-text citation has one

```

The acknowledgements section is where you give thanks to the people, organizations, and institutions that have supported you in your research. If relevant, include the grant ID # of your funding source. Institutions and organizations that have contributed to your research - but you do not belong to - can be thanked here.

## Activity - Next Steps

### Introduction

Congratulations on making it to the end of Microbial Mysteries!  Take a moment and reflect on all that you've accomplished during this semester, especially those of you who reported in the Welcome Poll "No experience" with Microbiology, Galaxy, and Scientific Research.  While the "Grad Student Motivation Level" PHD Comics spans years, it likely reflects the ups and downs as you developed and explored your hypothesis, including the thrill of presenting your work to people in our mini-symposium.  The feedback has been great with faculty impressed at what you’ve accomplished, the depth that you understand your projects, and even one scientist who does metagenomics research reporting that they learned a new trick or two!  


We’ll wrap up today with several next steps including completing feedback to improve the next offering of this course , researching opportunities to do more science, exploring communities where scientists openly share insights, and optionally sharing more work.

### Activity 1 – Complete Feedback

*Estimated time: 15 min*

#### Instructions

Help us improve this course as we work to grow enrollment to accommodate 32 to 64 students, incorporate graduate TAs and undergraduate course assistants and tutors,  and promote more computational training and research opportunities throughout departmental courses

## Update your CV

*Estimated time: 10 min*

Everyone who completes a C-MOOR project can add their experience to their resume or CV! We advise you and your students to do this as soon as possible after the end of class while your research project is still on your mind.

#### Resume or CV?

You may hear the terms resume and CV being used interchangeably. While both are drawn from the same information, they vary in brevity and focus.

A **resume** is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document of your experiences generally used for jobs outside of academia and research labs. It's not uncommon for people to have more than one resume, as it's best to tailor every resume to each specific role you're applying to.

A **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** is an extensive document that can take as many pages as needed to list the entirety of your research and academic experience. It often includes sections that aren't found in non-academic fields such as publications, conferences, and published papers. 

Most positions will detail which they require from applicants and most colleges and universities will be able to help you build either at your library or career center. We suggest that current students and recent graduates interested add their C-MOOR research experience to either their classwork or projects section. Remember to acknowledge the contributions of your team members if applicable; this does not count against you in your applications! Here are some examples of how you might word your experiences; notice how they're similar to an abstract in just one or two sentences:

- **An RNA-seq project:** Along with a partner, examined differential expression data of the *period (per)* gene along the *Drosophila melanogaster* midgut from a published dataset (Marianes & Spradling 2013) using DESeq2 and ClusterProfiler. We discovered an elevated expression of per in the anterior region of the midgut where the primary digestion and absorption of carbohydrates occur. Our results were presented as a research poster at the 2025 Kuntz Research Day symposium and have implications for using Drosophila as a model for the connection between the circadian rhythm and metabolic disorders.

- **A 16S project:** My group and I profiled the abundance of Archean ASVs in the gut microbiome from a published 16S study comparing the gut microbiota of people before, during, and after a standardized diet (Guthrie et al. 2022). As a part of this study, we created a PCoA and performed an alpha diversity analysis in phyloseq. Archean community members are often overlooked in microbiome studies; we found differential abundance in *Methanobacteria* between male and female participants regardless of diet and hypothesize this may be due to consumption of fiber reported by male subjects pre- and post-diet.

- **A WGS project**: Public data (SRA#######) from Robinson et al. (2021) was analyzed in Galaxy using Trimmomatic, Megahit, and Krona to determine the viral abundance in samples from tap water from various North American Lakes and make comparisons to lake depth. Viral abundance was correlated with geographic distance between samples; future studies could examine if this pattern persists in samples sourced from Europe and Oceana. 

Your blurb is a strong blurb when:

- [ ] &nbsp; You credit the source of your data (Citation, SRA #, Project #)
- [ ] &nbsp; You describe why your research project matters
- [ ] &nbsp; You list some of the computational platforms or software you used

**Q: Will people think I am an expert in genomics and bioinformatics if I put my project on my resume/CV? I don't want to look like a phony.**

A: As a current student or new graduate, you are not expected to have mastery over any scientific domain. What you are trying to show is you have taken an idea and brought it to completion, your ability to learn new concepts and skills, and your previous exposure to research. You can explain more about your role in the project in an interview.

**Q: Can I list things like R or Galaxy in my skills section?**

A: You can, however we suggest being explicit in your experience and add the level at which you feel comfortable with each respective platform. Are you R (Beginner) or R (Proficient)? Can you teach someone else how to do your project? Can you perform your project with novel data? How good are you at troubleshooting? This answer may seem contrary to the previous one, but remember that other people who are listing these platforms in their skills section includes computer/data scientists (majors) and bioinformaticians (majors), so people may assume mastery. Think about it the same way you would a foreign language. Spanish (Beginner) describes a different level of skill than 'just' Spanish. 

## C-MOOR Scholars

```

C-MOOR Scholars are research clubs that function as an extension of the C-MOOR curriculum. You can explore techniques and concepts from modules you've yet to take to learn about different approaches we can use to explore different questions through genomics, connect with other scholars and mentors, and experience the climate of a research lab. 

Fill out our [C-MOOR Scholars Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GJDpfG28k2utCVVcRXQraE-1coLS_GCX83irUyio9KE/viewform?edit_requested=true) if interested, and meet some [C-MOOR Scholars at Clovis Community College](https://www.cloviscollege.edu/alumni-and-community/c-moor/c-moor-scholars.html)!

**What C-MOOR Scholars is**:

  - A place to grow your skills
  - A place to network
  - A place to connect science with the greater community

**What C-MOOR Scholars is not**:

  - A commitment to pursuing research as a career
  - A graded class where we score work
  - A drop-in drop-out popular science club
  
Less formal than a class, more formal than just a gathering of like-minded minds, C-MOOR Scholars provides structure for your growth as a scientist. We are actively looking to recruit new scholars for chapters at our established sites (CCC, JHU, & NDMU); speak with your instructor for more information or reach out to us at the [C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum](help.c-moor.org) to hear about any remote opportunities we have.

## Pursue further research

Perhaps you're interested in pursuing research beyond what C-MOOR currently provides. Maybe you're more interested in wet lab work, or a specific model organism. We encourage you to try all sorts of different opportunities even if you feel totally comfortable working with C-MOOR so you can better understand what kind of roles suit you best. This section serves as a guide for some common jumping off points to find outside research opportunities.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dI8-_iVqbkzNMf11M4dK85E8ZW3OyZECs_YwMKw5fhs/edit#slide=id.g362974128df_0_98")

```

### Research opportunities at your institution

Many colleges and universities have research programs for their students or resources available to connect you to some. You can ask your instructor, adviser, or library for more information. Some popular programs include:

- **Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs (UROP):** Which often provide a database or pipeline of research opportunities for students at the univeristy or from surrounding areas. 

- **Research experiences for undergraduates (REU):** Similar to UROP, but generally open for a wider audience of students from outside the community. See the [NSF REU website](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu) for more information.

Opportunities come and go and often follow the academic-year in terms of availability. If you can't find something immediately, keep trying!

### Find a research lab to join

You can choose to pursue additional research opportunities in what we consider the more traditional way: by reaching out to a professor or research scientist whose work you are interested in and asking if they might be willing to have you in their lab. As these opportunities are at the discretion of the lab leader they will vary widely in their scope, duration, and ability to provide financial support.

An email to a potential research lab should contain:

- [ ] &nbsp;An introduction about yourself (name, class year, institution, major)
- [ ] &nbsp;1-2 sentences about your previous experience in research
- [ ] &nbsp;1-2 sentences about why you're interested in their lab specifically
- [ ] &nbsp;A polite, open ended request to work with them

> Dear Professor Penguin,

>My name is Student, and I am a junior at My University majoring in biology (or other). I read your chapter on the genetics yellow-eyed penguins in Penguins: Natural history and conservation, and then checked out your profile on the University website. My interests are broadly defined in environmental toxicology and I am interested in the work you are doing using eDNA and studies on the effects of plastic on developing penguin transcriptomes.

>I previously completed a project as a part of an RNA-seq miniCURE and have some exposure to working with DESeq2, though I still have much to learn. My group and I profiled the gene expression of the genes XYZ in the Drosophila midugt and I presented our poster at our university's research day poster session.

>Thank you for your time and consideration in reading my email. Please let me know if you are currently available to mentor an undergraduate in your lab and if you would be willing to have me as a potential student. I hope to hear from you soon!

Don't be surprised if it takes the researcher a while to get back to you or if they respond curtly. They likely get many requests and are very busy. Continue to reach out to labs and apply to programs; it is difficult to know when opportunities are available as funding fluctuates.

## BioDIGS

This section is primarily geared toward instructors as students will be able to get access to the BioDIGS data through their local C-MOOR Scholars chapter.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt= "Image test"}

```

**What is BioDIGS?**: [BioDIGS](biodigs.org) is a project from the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN), which aims to characterize the microbiome of soil throughout sites in the US while connecting scientists to research. 

**What makes BioDIGS different?:** Soil is hypothesized to be the most diverse system on our planet, and BioDIGS is gathering sequence data and matching environmental data to elucidate the connection of soil microbes to abiotic variables and human health. Students at participating sites can take the entire project from soil sampling all the way through computational analysis. Curricula and more information on how to get a soil sampling kit are available on the BioDIGS website.
