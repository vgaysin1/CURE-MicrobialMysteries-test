### Audience and Prerequisites {- .unlisted}

What is the target audience?

<!-- Example:
This module is designed for introductory biology courses.  Key ideas center around genes and homologs, and the proteins they encode.  We typically include this module as part of a Molecular Biology unit.
-->

**Prerequisites**:

  - Prereq 1
  - Prereq 2
  
Why are these needed?  Provide a brief explanation that will help instructors decide whether it's a good fit for their students.

<!-- Example:

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of genes and homology

The project portion of the module involves looking up genes in different databases (human and model organism). Students should have a basic understanding of what a gene is (and why we care about them), and why it makes sense to study similar genes (i.e. homologs) across different organisms.  This module will help solidify these concepts by having students investigate concrete examples of genes and their homologs.
